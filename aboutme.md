subtitle: Who is this person, anyway
---

I am currently a Senior Education Researcher at Math for America, where I draw upon my ten years in the classroom to help support NYC public STEM teachers. I also teach graduate classwork in Earth Science Education at the American Museum of Natural History.

I'm massively into the following avenues of research:  
* Science Education
* Teacher Education
* Design-Based Research
* Social Network Analysis 
 
I draw from a few frameworks in my research, including situated learning and communities of practice. I believe that the methodology follows the question, and evaluate the initiatives I design and support using Qualtrics, R, and NVivo, as the need desires. 

### When I'm not doing this

I am either spending time with my wife and son, or paddling along the Hudson River
