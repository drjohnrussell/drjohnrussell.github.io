Hi there! I'm John Russell. In my work as a professor and education researcher, I love **sensemaking in data, science and education**, learning and implementing **systems of professional learning**, and the spaces that support the ways in which these pursuits support each other. Outside of work, I'm a **kayaker**, a lover of **board games**, and an explorer (mostly via my bicycle) of **New York City**, where I live. Please explore to learn more [about me](about.qmd) and my work!
